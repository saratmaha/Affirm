		<p>For all of the questions, assume you have a database with the following tables and data:</p>

		<p>1) If you designed the database, would you have done anything differently? What and why?

        <h5>1) I see an opportunity to eliminate the director object all together. The I way I see is director 
            (crew) are people working for a movie. We can still keep the name Actor but this has more abstract meaning
            which will include all people working in a movie. So my approach is to create a picklist
            value on the Actor called appearance with values (On Screen and Background etc) and create one more 
            dependent picklist to futher categorize as department such as (direction, music etc). This way a 
            single movie we can accomodate all crew and we can still have clear distinction between who appears onscreen
            verus who is in background using the picklist and dependent picklist values
        </h5>

        <h5>2) I have following questions that should be directed by business
            <ul>
                <li>A movie can contain multiple actors - This has been taken care in current design (Look up to Movie)
                Question: It is not uncommon for actors to be working in multiple movies at the same time 
                Then -> Current design is not scalable to accomodate this data model. So we create a ActorMovie junction
                object to accomodate this requirement
                </li>
                <li>
                A movie can contain a single director - This has been taken care in current design
                Question:Similar to above scenario, it is not uncommon for a director to be working in more than one movie 
                at the same time
                Then -> Current design is not scalable to accomodate this data model. So we create a MovieDirector junction
                object to accomodate this requirement
                </li>
                <li>
                Relationship between Actor and director can be eliminated if we change the database design as described 
                in my response to my first quesion
                </li>
            </ul>               
        </h5>

		<p>2) Write a query that will tell us movie titles whose budgets were over 2,000,000 (or unknown) and did not receive any oscars.
        <h5>
            SELECT Name,Budget__c,Oscars__c FROM Movie__c where (Budget__c > 2000000.00 or Budget__c = null) and Oscars__c = 0
        </h5>

		<p>3) Write a query that will tell us how many actors are in each movie.  Results should be alphabetized by the name of the movie.</p>
        <h5>
            Since the Relationship is not mentioned, I assume Actor to movie is tightly couple and is 
            master-detail. So I created a rollup summary field on the object to achieve this functionality. This 
            has drawbacks too if we have multiple roll up summaries because any time the child is updated then 
            it triggers parent record to update as well. It should be used considerably
            
            <ul>
			<li>SELECT name,Actor_Count__c FROM Movie__c order by name </li>

            <li>or</li>

            <li>SELECT count(Id),Movie__r.Name FROM Actor__c group by Movie__r.Name</li>
			</ul>
        </h5>
